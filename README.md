# Paint-me-up
Android AR Game Prototype

- When downloading the project, after opening the project in the Unity Editor, switch build profile to Android, then go to Assets -> Scenes -> GameScene_MoreModular for used game scene

- Game App created in unity using AR Foundations, ProBuilder and Unity 6 XR Interaction Toolkit for input detection
    
- Move around to detect the ground, press the button to create a cube, and start the game. You have 180 seconds to find the colours shown in the UI in the real world. Once any correct colour is selected or 30 seconds passes a new one is shown. Every correct color found is painted on one cube face!

- Sounds, shaking and particle effects were added after initial build

- NOTE: Still has a bug regarding UI not updating correctly with some completed colours OR UI is correct, but some colors are being detected incorrectly and then completed

- Script Structure: TODO

- External Sound Assets Used:
